/// Error type for memory allocation failures.

/// Arena methods return this error when the underlying global
/// allocator fails to allocate a memory chunk. Best action is
/// to abort the current operation and release any other
/// allocated resources.
///
/// Details about the failed allocation are not included to make
/// this error as lightweight as possible. Usually there isn't
/// any fragmentation with the bump allocator, and the allocation
/// size is in relation to the size of the bytes given to the
/// parser. Including more exact information would harm the
/// successful hot path for very little extra value.
