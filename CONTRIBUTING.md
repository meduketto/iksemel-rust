# Contributing to iks

Thank you very much for your interest in contributing! :heart:

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to iks. You can:

### 1. Share your experience

I'm interested in hearing about your experience with iks whether
it is negative or positive. Feel free to write me an email, or
publish a blog post!

### 2. Submit a bug report

Bug reports are always welcome. Most useful reports include a
preferably minimal way to reproduce the issue, such as an example
XML document or a code snippet. If you also have trouble reliably
reproducing the issue, a report with as much as information you
can collect is still useful. I will try my best to fix bugs
within a reasonable timeframe.

You can report via GitHub issues, or directly to my email address
if the information is sensitive.

### 3. Send a feature request

Feature requests are welcome too, but please check if they align
with the project goals and philosophy described in the DESIGN.md
file.

Be aware that this is a spare time project for me, and I have
real work and life, so feature requests are not guaranteed to be
implemented. Also see the next way below.

Always use GitHub issues for feature requests.

### 4. Write code, tests, documentation


#### Licencing

#### Coding Standards
